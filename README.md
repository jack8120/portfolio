# portfolio

Putting this portfolio together has been an excellent opportunity to expand my skills as a front end developer. 
I've learned a wealth of new CSS tricks and had an opportunity to put a lot of skills to use in one build. 

Learned to deploy with a digital ocean droplet and in the process of attaching the domain jacktorn.dev.
